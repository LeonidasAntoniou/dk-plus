Fly the vehicle in a SQUARE path using velocity vectors (the underlying code calls the
SET_POSITION_TARGET_LOCAL_NED command with the velocity parameters enabled).

The code also sets the yaw (MAV_CMD_CONDITION_YAW) using the `set_yaw()` method in each segment
so that the front of the vehicle points in the direction of travel
